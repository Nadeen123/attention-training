# Attention Training

### Description

Attention Training is a project that helps you to know if you have an ADHD mental disorder and which type you may have. It gives you more information about the ADHD type you have and tips to help you improve your skills and overcome your challenges.

### Motivation:
Neurodiverse individuals traditionally struggle with focus, social interaction, time-management and memory. We want to provide educational systems tailored to high-variance individuals (e.g. ADHD, autism and dyslexia) building skills to address these unmet needs.
